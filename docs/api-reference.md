# 📘 API Reference – OpenCancel and the Future of Subscription Identity

## ❓Why OpenCancel Matters

As the number of digital services continues to explode, so does the complexity of managing subscriptions across disconnected platforms. Each service has its own cancellation process, login flow, and identity handling — making it frustratingly difficult for users to control their digital commitments.

OpenCancel was born to fix that. It provides a **unified, standardized, and API-first way** to manage subscription lifecycles — cancel, activate, pause, or switch — across services with a predictable structure.

## 🔒 The Identity Problem

To cancel a subscription through OpenCancel, we need to authenticate the user. But here's the problem:

* Should we generate a token for each individual platform?
* Should we force users to manage and share access tokens across services?
* Or... should we build a neutral middle layer?

At first glance, building a **unified platform to aggregate all subscriptions** seems ideal. It would allow users to link all their accounts and generate **one token** for use across all OpenCancel-compatible platforms. Elegant? Yes. Scalable? Not really.

If such a hub received millions of cancellation requests per second, it would quickly become a bottleneck — not to mention a potential privacy risk.

## 🧠 A Bigger Idea: The Digital Subscription Passport

What we really need is a **global digital identity for subscriptions** — an open standard, like DNS or SSL, for identifying users and granting secure permissions to manage recurring payments.

Imagine a world where:

* Every person has a **Digital Subscription Passport (DSP)**.
* It contains standardized metadata (email, country, age, consents, billing preferences).
* It can be verified and read by any platform via OpenCancel-compliant endpoints.
* It doesn’t rely on one centralized company — but on a shared, open protocol.

We aren’t there yet. But we need to start building in that direction.

## 💬 Let’s Start the Discussion

This repository is just a seed — a draft of what **could** become an internet-wide standard.

We're inviting developers, platforms, and designers to:

* ✅ Review the OpenCancel spec
* 💡 Propose use cases and limitations
* 🔐 Discuss identity, authentication, and privacy flows
* 🌐 Debate the role of DSPs (Digital Subscription Passports)
* 📣 Suggest alternative models for distributed validation

> Help shape the way subscription identity should work — not just for us, but for everyone.
